        Upon starting my project and finishing it up, my design has changed drastically. I originally wanted to go for a more vertical page than what I ended up with. However, I made the conscious choice to change my idea, it did not happen as a late minute change. Upon peer reviewing my crit group member's projects, I saw that I enjoyed a horizontal approach to the site much more than a vertical approach. I did run into problems with my grid in the beginning that affected my change. I recently found the problem, if I had found it sooner I would've gone for my original design.

        Working on the actual java script code was a lot of fun as well. I made many minor spelling mistakes that cost me a lot of time but other than that I did not encounter any ground breaking issues. At first I was puzzled on how to get both the Amiibo and Game Series to work as intended, but after querying the drop down from the API itself, the problems resolved themselves.

        To make sure I met the requirements needed for the project, I made sure to write them down and always have them near me when I began to work. When I completed one of the necessary requirements, I crossed it off on my whiteboard to manually keep track of what I had and hadn't done already. I started with the basics, the html structure, and then worked on the javascript. I made sure that my html and javascript had a search field, a search button, a dropdown menu, and an additionall way of searching thru content as well(in which case my additional search function was searching with game series as well).

        To give myself a grade on how I think I ended up doing, I think I'd give myself a high B or a low A. I'm very proud with getting everything that I wanted to work within the API. I got all my features done and I've cleaned up my code as well! That being said, there are a couple places that need work in the future. I like how my design ended up turning out, but I wish it was a tad bit more polished and alligned. It's fine for now and it looks pretty good but it could look better definetly. I'll need to work on my css skills for the future. Additionally, while I got error handling completed so that if a 404 comes up it'll let the user know the Amiibo doesn't exist, I'm still getting errors in the console. Overall, I think I did really well on the assignment as I was pretty daunted coming in. There's definetly room for improvement as previously mentioned though.
